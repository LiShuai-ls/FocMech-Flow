# FocMech-Flow
An automatic workflow to obtain the Focal Mechanisms with P-wave first-motion polarities.

The inversion of the focal mechanisms is performed by the grid search method (CHNYTX), and the relevant code can be contacted to Ph.D. Yu Chunquan(yucq@sustech.edu.cn) of the Southern University of Science and Technology.
